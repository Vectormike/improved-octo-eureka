# Instructions


## Features

- GraphQL w/ [playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database modelling, migration and type-safe access (Postgres)
- 🔐 JWT authentication w/ [passport-jwt](https://github.com/mikenicholson/passport-jwt)


## Overview


## Prisma Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install [Nestjs CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages) to start and [generate CRUD resources](https://trilon.io/blog/introducing-cli-generators-crud-api-in-1-minute)

```bash
# npm
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Install the dependencies for the Nest application:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

### 2. PostgreSQL with Docker

Setup a development PostgreSQL with Docker. Copy [.env.example](./.env.example) and rename to `.env` - `cp .env.example .env` - which sets the required environments for PostgreSQL such as `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `POSTGRES_DB`. Update the variables as you wish and select a strong password.

Start the PostgreSQL database

```bash
npm run docker:db
```

### 3. Prisma Migrate

[Prisma Migrate](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/tree/master/docs/prisma-migrate) is used to manage the schema and migration of the database. Prisma datasource requires an environment variable `DATABASE_URL` for the connection to the PostgreSQL database. Prisma reads the `DATABASE_URL` from the root [.env](./.env) file.

Use Prisma Migrate in your [development environment](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-preview-b5eno5g08d0b#evolving-the-schema-in-development) to

1. Creates `migration.sql` file
2. Updates Database Schema
3. Generates Prisma Client

```bash
npm run migrate:dev
```

If you like to customize your `migration.sql` file run the following command. After making your customizations run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply it.

```bash
npm run migrate:dev:create
```

If you are happy with your database changes you want to deploy those changes to your [production database](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-preview-b5eno5g08d0b#applying-migrations-in-production-and-other-environments). Use `prisma migrate deploy` to apply all pending migrations, can also be used in CI/CD pipelines as it works without prompts.

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
# or
npm run migrate:deploy
```

### 4. Prisma: Prisma Client JS

[Prisma Client JS](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/api) is a type-safe database client auto-generated based on the data model.

Generate Prisma Client JS by running

> **Note**: Every time you update [schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma) re-generate Prisma Client JS

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

### 5. Seed the database data with this script

Execute the script with this command:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### 6. Start NestJS Server

Run Nest Server in Development mode:

```bash
npm run start

# watch mode
npm run start:dev
```

GraphQL Playground for the NestJS Server is available here: http://localhost:3000/graphql

**[⬆ back to top](#overview)**

## GraphQL Playground

Open up the [example GraphQL queries](graphql/auth.graphql) and copy them to the GraphQL Playground. Some queries and mutations are secured by an auth guard. You have to acquire a JWT token from `signup` or `login`. Add the `accessToken`as followed to **HTTP HEADERS** in the playground and replace `YOURTOKEN` here:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer YOURTOKEN"
}
```

## Rest Api

[RESTful API](http://localhost:3000/api) documentation available with Swagger.

## Docker

Nest server is a Node.js application and it is easily [dockerized](https://nodejs.org/de/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/).

See the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) on how to build a Docker image of your Nest server.

Now to build a Docker image of your own Nest server simply run:

```bash
# give your docker image a name
docker build -t <your username>/nest-prisma-server .
# for example
docker build -t nest-prisma-server .
```

After Docker build your docker image you are ready to start up a docker container running the nest server:

```bash
docker run -d -t -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env nest-prisma-server
```

Now open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to verify that your nest server is running.

When you run your NestJS application in a Docker container update your [.env](.env) file

```diff
- DB_HOST=localhost
# replace with name of the database container
+ DB_HOST=postgres

# Prisma database connection
+ DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}?schema=${DB_SCHEMA}&sslmode=prefer
```

If `DATABASE_URL` is missing in the root `.env` file, which is loaded into the Docker container, the NestJS application will exit with the following error:

```bash
(node:19) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL.
  -->  schema.prisma:3
   |
 2 |   provider = "postgresql"
 3 |   url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
```

### Docker Compose

You can also setup a the database and Nest application with the docker-compose

```bash
# building new NestJS docker image
docker-compose build
# or
npm run docker:build

# start docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
# or
npm run docker
```

## Schema Development

Update the Prisma schema `prisma/schema.prisma` and after that run the following two commands:

```bash
npx prisma generate
# or in watch mode
npx prisma generate --watch
# or
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:generate:watch
```

## NestJS - Api Schema

The [schema.graphql](./src/schema.graphql) is generated with [code first approach](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start#code-first) from the models, resolvers and input classes.

You can use [class-validator](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/validation) to validate your inputs and arguments.

### Resolver

To implement the new query, a new resolver function needs to be added to `users.resolver.ts`.

```ts
@Query(returns => User)
async getUser(@Args() args): Promise<User> {
  return await this.prisma.client.user(args);
}
```

Restart the NestJS server and this time the Query to fetch a `user` should work.

## GraphQL Client

A GraphQL client is necessary to consume the GraphQL api provided by the NestJS Server.

Checkout [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) a popular GraphQL client which offers several clients for React, Angular, Vue.js, Native iOS, Native Android and more.

### Angular

#### Setup

To start using [Apollo Angular](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/basics/setup.html) simply run in an Angular and Ionic project:

```bash
ng add apollo-angular
```

`HttpLink` from apollo-angular requires the `HttpClient`. Therefore, you need to add the `HttpClientModule` to the `AppModule`:

```ts
imports: [BrowserModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    ...,
    GraphQLModule],
```

You can also add the `GraphQLModule` in the `AppModule` to make `Apollo` available in your Angular App.

You need to set the URL to the NestJS GraphQL Api. Open the file `src/app/graphql.module.ts` and update `uri`:

```ts
const uri = 'http://localhost:3000/graphql';
```




#### Subscriptions

To execute a subscription you can use:

```ts
this.apollo.subscribe({
  query: YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_QUERY,
});
```
